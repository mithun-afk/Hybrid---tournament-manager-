# Hybrid Sports Tournament Manager

A Python-based command-line application designed to manage sports tournaments using both Round Robin and Knockout formats. This project helps organizers efficiently track match results, standings, and tournament progression.

## Features

- Supports both **Round Robin** and **Knockout** formats
- Automatically generates fixtures
- Calculates and displays a **points table** for league stages
- Automatically progresses top teams to knockout rounds
- Displays final winners and match results
- Simple and interactive CLI interface

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries)
- File Handling (optional for saving results)
- CLI (Command Line Interface)

## Project Goals

This project was developed to apply algorithmic thinking to real-world sports event planning. It simulates the workflow of actual tournament management â€” from scheduling group matches to generating elimination rounds based on performance.

## Academic Context

Built as part of an independent learning project to improve skills in Python, logic design, and user-focused tools. The system models basic logic behind tournament management tools used in schools, colleges, and sports leagues.

## Future Improvements

- Web or GUI-based interface (Tkinter / Flask)
- Persistent storage for team data
- Live scoreboard or player statistics module
- Admin login and editable match scores
